Note:
Because HackMD, the Tool we have used to write the documentation, uploads
images to imgur when pasting them into the document all of the images have
received a random string as identifier. Since we have just used "grep"'d the
urls out of the file to download them we did not rename them to something meaningful,
Since the images themselves do not make any sense anyways.
