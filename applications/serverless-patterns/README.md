# Amazon API Gateway REST API with AWS Lambda proxy integration

This pattern in CDK offers a boilerlate to generate an Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoint with a a greedy proxy ("{proxy+}") and "ANY" method from the specified path, meaning it will accept by default any method and any path. The Lambda function provided in TypeScript only returns the path.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) (AWS CDK) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory its source code folder:
    ```bash
      cd apigw-lambda-cdk/src
    ```
3. From the command line, use npm to install the development dependencies:
    ```bash
      npm install
    ```
4. To deploy from the command line use the following:
    ```bash
      npx cdk deploy --app 'ts-node .'
    ```

## Testing

1. After deployment, the output shows the API Gateway URL with the Lambda integration, for example: ```ServerlessLandApi.ServerlessLandEndpointC36EEEC4 = https://<random-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/```.
1. Accessing the URL in a browser, you see: ```Hello, your path is: "/"```.
3. This page logs any path you type after "/". You can use this as a starting point as a general purpose endpoint for various types of applications.

## Cleanup
 
1. From the command line, use the following in the source folder
    ```bash
    npx cdk destroy --app 'ts-node .'
    ```
2. Confirm the removal and wait for the resource deletion to complete.
